edison-gui
==========

This desktop application was created as a project for a course during my studies. 
It's main purpouse was to demonstrate my knowladge of Java programming language and its fundamentals.

I had fun creating it because it mocks university information system Edison.

This application was developed using JDBC and Swing application framework. It uses LDAP to connect to data source.
